## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jamey Nguyen, and I'm primarily interested in full-stack development.

I have a wide variety of interests which is what led me to be interested in full-stack in the first place!
As a junior at Iowa State University, I've taken both front-end and back-end coursework, and have received guidance on networking and infrastructure concepts during
previous internships. I'm well suited to work in a variety of roles and am very adaptable.
